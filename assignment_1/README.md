# Assignment 1 - Image search

This repository contains the code related to Assignment 1 for Visual Analytics. 
The script takes a path to an image directory and the filename of a target image within the directory as inputs. 
The first output of the script is a csv file that holds the chi squared distance between target image and the three images in the directory that has the shortest distance to the target image.
The second output of the script is an image containing the target image and the three images with the shortest distance to the target image.

ERROR: I had issues with creating the image of the four images stacked together, and ucloud kept crashing and I eventually ran out of time.
I googled quite a bit and tried some different methods, but I couldn't get the dimensions of the images to match so that I could stack them. 
I still would like feedback on what I've got and what works, so I commented out all the code relating to creating the stacked image, so you don't have to look at that (it's quite messy - there are different code snippets and they don't all go together) and so the rest of the code will run.
